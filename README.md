# **Virtual Magical Board 🧮✨**  

## **Overview**  
The **Virtual Magical Board** is an AI-powered interactive math-solving application that allows users to write mathematical equations using their fingers. The system recognizes hand gestures to solve the equations and provides real-time solutions using **Google's Gemini AI**.  

## **Features 🚀**  
✅ **Hand Gesture-Based Writing:** Use your index finger to write mathematical equations.  
✅ **AI-Powered Math Solver:** Uses **Google Gemini AI** to process handwritten equations and provide solutions.  
✅ **Real-Time Interaction:** Display webcam feed and solve equations instantly.  
✅ **Gesture-Controlled Eraser:** Raise all five fingers to erase the canvas.  
✅ **Simple and User-Friendly:** Built using **OpenCV, Streamlit, and HandTrackingModule** for seamless interaction.  

## **How It Works 🖐️**  
1️⃣ **Write the Equation:** Use your index finger to draw the math equation on the virtual board.  
2️⃣ **Solve the Equation:** Raise your **thumb and three fingers** (from the thumb side) to send the equation to **Gemini AI** for solving.  
3️⃣ **Erase the Canvas:** Raise **all five fingers** to clear the screen and start a new equation.  

## **Tech Stack 🛠️**  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – For real-time webcam feed and image processing  
- **cvzone.HandTrackingModule** – Detects hand gestures  
- **Google Gemini AI (Generative AI Model)** – Solves mathematical equations  
- **PIL (Pillow)** – Converts canvas to an image  
- **NumPy** – For array manipulation  
- **Streamlit** – Provides an interactive web-based UI  

## **Installation & Setup 🔧**  
1️⃣ **Clone the Repository:**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Virtual-Magical-Board.git  
cd Virtual-Magical-Board  
```
3️⃣ **Run the Application:**  
```bash  
streamlit run math.py  
```

## **Gesture Guide 🤖**  
| Gesture  | Action  |  
|----------|---------|  
| ☝️ (Index Finger Up) | Write on the virtual board |  
| ✋ (All Five Fingers Up) | Erase the board |  
| 👍+🤞🤞🤞 (Thumb + Three Fingers) | Solve the equation |  

## **Future Enhancements 🔮**  
✅ Support for **multiple equations in one session**  
✅ Improve **handwriting recognition accuracy**  
✅ Add **voice feedback for solutions**
